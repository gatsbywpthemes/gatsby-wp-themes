# Build your awesome website with Gatsby, WordPress and Ginger theme.

Introduction comes here...

## ðŸš€All that you need to get it running.

## Setting up your WordPress Website.

You will need a running WordPress installation. Gatsby will fetch the data from your WordPress website. There are some configuration options that you need to follow:

### Mandatory Plugins

You need to install and activate the [wpgraphql plugin.](https:www.wpgraphql.com/) You can download the latest release [here.](https:github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases) Install it on your WordPress site from the .zip file.

### Permalinks structure

This step is essentialfor your internal links to be mapped adequately from your WordPress site to your Gatsby one.
You can configure your WordPress permalinks structure in `Settings > Permalinks`.
Make sure to check the **Post name** option.

### SEO Settings

Make sure to discourage search engines from indexing your WordPress website. You do not want to be penalized for the duplicated content. This can be done via `Settings > Reading`.

Another solution is to install the [Headless Node](https://wordpress.org/plugins/headless-mode/) WordPress plugin. Headless Node sets up a redirect for all users trying to access the site.

### Optional - Forms

Our themes are compatible with Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin. If you want to have a form on your website, you need to install Contact Form 7 and set up your form.

## Configure your Gatsby site - config.js

The default options are as follows:

```javascript
const config = {
  wordPressUrl: ``,
  pathPrefix: "",
  paginationPrefix: `page`,
  postsPerPage: 10,

Here you decide which fonts should be installed.  
The Ginger theme uses two typefaces **Abril Fatface** for headings and **Fira Sans** for the body text. Both of them are Google fonts.  
If you want to use other typefaces, you will have to modify the `fonts` setting in the config.js.  
You will also have to edit the `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` file to assign your fonts as `heading` or `body`.

examples:

If you want to use system fonts :

```javascript
/* config.js */

fonts: []
```

```javascript
/* src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js */
fonts: {
  heading: "Georgia, serif",
  body: "Arial, sans-serif",
},
fontWeights: {
  heading: 700,
},
```

If you want to use some other Google Fonts:

```javascript
/* config.js */

fonts: ["Alfa Slab One", "Raleway:400,400i,700,700i"]
```

```javascript
/* src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js */
fonts: {
  heading: "Alfa Slab One, serif",
  body: "Raleway, sans-serif",
},
fontWeights: {
  body: 400,
},
```

`(default: true)`

If you want to add dark mode switcher.

## Overriding Theme Styles

### Overriding Typography Settings

You can override the typography settings in `ginger/configTypography.js`  
Uncomment each line that you wish to modify and set your values.

You can change the fonts settings to any system fonts or any of the Google fonts.
When choosing Google fonts please make sure that you add them also in `config.js` ([see here](#config-fonts))

> You can modify the baseFontSize, that is the root level font size which will affect the entire site. Please note that we use mostly rem variables. Changing the baseFontSize will scale the majority of elements.

### Overriding Color Settings

You can override any of the colors used by the theme in `configColors.js.` You can modify colors both in the default and dark mode.

### Overriding Sizes Settings

You can modify the breakpoints values as well as the `header`, `content` and `sidebar` sizes in `configSizes.js`
The breakpoints works in combination with the css properties represented as an array.
That means that the header size is 4.5rem for screen not larger than 40em, and 6rem for screen not larger than 64em.
If you add a third value in the header array, it will be applied for screens larger than 64em.

```javascript
/* configSizes.js */
const sizesSettings = {
  //breakpoints: ["40em", "64em"],
  sizes: {
    //header: ['4.5rem', '6rem'],
    //content: '52.5rem',
    //sidebar: '29.25rem',
  },
}
```

example:

```javascript
/* configSizes.js */
const sizesSettings = {
  //breakpoints: ["40em", "64em"],
  sizes: {
    header: ["4.5rem", "6rem", "4.5rem"],
    //content: '52.5rem',
    //sidebar: '29.25rem',
  },
}
```

### Further Changes

You can also style your website with css. This can be useful if you have to target some specific element or add some more complex styling. You should put your css in `styles/style.scss.` If you are not familiar with sass, you can write plain css in this file.
