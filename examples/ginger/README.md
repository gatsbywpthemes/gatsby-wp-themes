## ðŸš€ What you need to get it running?

### Setting up your WordPress Website.

You will need a running WordPress installation. Gatsby will fetch the data from your WordPress website. There are some configuration options that you need to follow:

#### Mandatory Plugins

You need to install and activate the [wpgraphql plugin.](https:www.wpgraphql.com/) You can download the latest release from [here.](https:github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases) and install it on your WordPress site from the .zip file.

#### Permalinks structure

This step is important for your internal links to be properly mapped from your WordPress site to your Gatsby one.
You can configure your WordPress permalinks structure in `Settings > Permalinks`. Make sure to check the **Post name** option.

#### SEO Settings

Make sure to discourage search engines from indexing your WordPress website. You do not want to be penalized for the duplicated content. This can be done via `Settings > Reading`.

#### Optional - Forms

Our themes are compatible with Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin. If you want to have a form on your website, you need to install Contact Form 7 and set up your form.
