# Build your awesome website with Gatsby, WordPress and Ginger theme.

Introduction comes here...

## ðŸš€All that you need to get it running.

### Setting up your WordPress Website.

You will need a running WordPress installation. Gatsby will fetch the data from your WordPress website. There are some configuration options that you need to follow:

#### Mandatory Plugins

You need to install and activate the [wpgraphql plugin.](https:www.wpgraphql.com/) You can download the latest release [here.](https:github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases) Install it on your WordPress site from the .zip file.

#### Permalinks structure

This step is essentialfor your internal links to be mapped adequately from your WordPress site to your Gatsby one.
You can configure your WordPress permalinks structure in `Settings > Permalinks`.
Make sure to check the **Post name** option.

#### SEO Settings

Make sure to discourage search engines from indexing your WordPress website. You do not want to be penalized for the duplicated content. This can be done via `Settings > Reading`.

Another solution is to install the [Headless Node](https://wordpress.org/plugins/headless-mode/) WordPress plugin. Headless Node sets up a redirect for all users trying to access the site.

#### Optional - Forms

Our themes are compatible with Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin. If you want to have a form on your website, you need to install Contact Form 7 and set up your form.

### Configure your Gatsby site - config.js

The default options are as follows:

```javascript
const config = {
  wordPressUrl: ``,
  uploadsPath: `wp-content/uploads`,
  postsPrefix: ``,
  postsPath: ``,
  paginationPrefix: `page`,
  postsPerPage: 10,
  addComments: true,
  menuName: "main",
  gingerWidgets: [`SocialFollow`, `RecentPosts`, `Categories`, `Tags`],

#### Options

**wordPressUrl** (required)

Provide a url to your WordPress website.

**uploadsPath** (optional)

`(default: wp-content/uploads)`

The prefix for the posts. If you change it, make sure to set the permalinks structure on your WordPress site accordingly.

This is an important setting. It should be left empty if your WordPress homepage displays your latest posts. This corresponds to the default in Settings > Reading > Your homepage displays.

Example

```javascript
postsPath: "blog"

```

---

**_siteUrl_** (obligatory for a production website)

**twitterSummaryCardImage**

When sharing your content on Twitter, articles will use their featured image for the Twitter card.
Other pages will use a common twitterSummaryCardImage. Please make sure to place it in the `/static` folder. Your image should be square and at least 144px x 144px.

---

**fonts**

`(type: Array, default: ["abril fatface", "fira sans"])`

Here you decide what fonts should be installed.
The Ginger theme uses two typefaces **Abril Fatface** for headings and **Fira Sans** for the body text. Both of them are Google fonts.
If you want to use other typefaces, you will have to modify the `fonts` setting in the config.js. You will also have to edit the `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` file to assign your fonts as `heading` or `body`.

Examples:

If you want to use system fonts :

```javascript
/* config.js */

fonts: []
```

```javascript
/* src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js */
fonts: {
  heading: "Georgia, serif",
  body: "Arial, sans-serif",
},
fontWeights: {
  heading: 700,
},
```

If you want to use some other Google Fonts:

```javascript
/* config.js */

fonts: ["Alfa Slab One", "Raleway:400,400i,700,700i"]
```

```javascript
/* src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js */
fonts: {
  heading: "Alfa Slab One, serif",
  body: "Raleway, sans-serif",
},
fontWeights: {
  body: 400,
},
```

Please note that the font family names are case sensitive. You can choose font variants that you want to install.
